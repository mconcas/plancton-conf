## voluntary-config

Repository for a set of configuration files for [Plancton](https://github.com/mconcas/plancton), a voluntary computing project.
Depending on the environment you may need to choose between some branches:
*  **head-common/dev** Currently the configuration files for the head+submit machine remains the same, thus you just need to clone this branch into the `/etc/condor` path.
*  **to-infn/dev** This developement branch is built for the Torino INFN network (originally thought as the end user), for further information you can email [me](mconcas@cern.ch).
*  **openstack-cern/dev** This developement branch is fot test-purpose-only, easily deployable o the CERN Openstack infrastructure.
