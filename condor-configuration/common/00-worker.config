# HTCondor configuration for an execute node
#
# by Dario Berzano <dario.berzano@cern.ch> and Matteo Concas <matteo.concas@cern.ch>
#
# This worker.config file configures an HTCondor instance inside a container as Startd: this
# node is running jobs.
#
# Password authentication and encryption are enabled by default for
# communications between daemons.
#
# This configuration uses the Condor Connection Broker (CCB): this container can be
# behind a firewall and may not expose any specific port since it does not need to accept
#Â connections. Instead, it connects to the Central Collector acting as Connection Broker.
#
# Firewall settings: no ports open.
#
# See this[1] document for setting up large Condor pools.
